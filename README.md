# The Based License
###### v1.4.1

### A based, copyleft, [libre](https://stop.voring.me/notes/8zk7z02lgy), anti-NFT code license.

### :warning: Warning: This license isn't legally viable as pointed out by [#6](https://github.com/ThatOneCalculator/BASED-LICENSE/issues/6) and if you're looking for a serious license, consider the (A)GPL3 or the MPL2. This was mostly written jokingly and I'm not a legal expert, please keep this in mind when using the BASED license.

The based license is licensed under the based license.

To use, simply copy the contents of [LICENSE](./LICENSE), replace the holder and date with the appropriate data, and add to your code repository.
